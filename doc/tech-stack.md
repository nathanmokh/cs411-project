For the back end, we were interested in learning Flask, exploiting our knowledge of Python. Flask is also a modular framework which makes it very easy for us to add or remove flask packages in the future. We’ve also considered Django as an alternative. However Django comes packages with a server-side rendering functionalities which we won’t need since we’ll be using a frontend library to handle the view. Additionally, we’ve also considered Express.js as a simple lightweight web framework. However it ultimately came down to what programming language our team was interested in and we wanted to learn more about backend development in Python.

For the frontend, we chose to use Angular because of its robust CLI developed by the Angular team that can enable us to rapidly build components and services. We’ve also considered React and Vue.js as well but both of those frameworks require additional packages (such as Redux and React-Router) in order to make a full-featured website. Because we expect our frontend to be relatively simple, we chose to use Angular which comes prepackaged with routers and other critical supportive functions needed to make a website. Finally, developing in Typescript will help us write code quicker that are less prone to errors because it’ll force us to use the typing system. Our hope is that this will help us detect bugs during compile time rather than runtime.
