# Project Proposal

## Idea 1
Our first idea is to visualize news articles on a spinning globe. As the globe spins, news article relating to the location currently displayed will be shown to the user. It would deliver value to the user because news websites tend to show articles that are only relevant to the user's location. Geolocations and news article would be two data sets that we would utilize. In addition, we would also utilize Facebook in order tag specific articles that might be of special interest to the user. These special articles would have a visual indicator. 

## Idea 2
Our second idea is to use social media platform (Facebook, Twitter, etc) to fetch their political preferences to connect them to organizations and politicians who share their passions. We would be using OAuth to access user data, and then storing their political preferences in a database. Political/Government API such as OpenSecret will be used to determine whether certain representatives support the issues the users are concerned with.
